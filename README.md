GoldList
========

GoldList is a KAG Public Server listing app for iOS written in Objective-C


Why Release the Code?
======================

This application was submitted to apple but was rejected under no continued entertainment value.

I have decided to release this code open source to the community so people can learn :

* how to parse JSON
* Connect to Web Services
* Use UITableView with custom views

Do you provide support?
=======================

This application is released as is and I will not be supporting the development of this code.
